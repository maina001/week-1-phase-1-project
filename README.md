MOTOrHUB Website
This is a website for selling cars. It is built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and uses styling to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The website displays information about various cars, including images and prices, and allows users to browse and filter the available options.

Installation
To use this website, you will need to install a web browser (such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) and have an internet connection.

Usage
To access the website, go to the URL where it is hosted (e.g. via RapidAPI). The homepage will display a list of cars for sale, with thumbnail images and basic information about each one. You can use the filter options on the left side of the page to narrow down the selection by make, model, year, and other criteria. Clicking on a car will bring up a detailed view with additional information and larger images.
